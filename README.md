# libremotec

This is a toy project which provides "real remote execution". That means, operations like accessing the file system (the only one implemented now) can be sent to another host transparently. It uses the `LD_PRELOAD` mechanism to achieve this.

# Compatibility

GCC and Clang work. Only posix'y OSes is supported.

# Example

To run the `cat` application which reads a file from remote location, run the following:

    # on remote (file access side)
    ./server
    
    # on local (cat execution side)
    LD_PRELOAD=./libremotec.so LOCAL_PATHS=/dev:/usr/lib REMOTE_SERVER=remote.ip.addr LIBREMOTEC_DEBUG=1 cat /etc/resolv.conf

The result should give some idea about what's going on:

    open() on remote file /etc/resolv.conf
    opened /etc/resolv.conf, local 2048, remote 5
    fstat() on remote fd 2048
    read() 131072 bytes on remote fd 2048
    # Generated by resolvconf
    nameserver 192.168.0.1
    read() 131072 bytes on remote fd 2048
